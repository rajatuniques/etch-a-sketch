# etch-a-sketch

I made this project to further refine my DOM manipulation and CSS Flexbox skills.

By default, you are given a 100 X 100 canvas to draw upon.
To do, you just have to move your mouse around the canvas to draw on it.
Currently, this project is not optimized for mobile devices but one should be able to draw pixel-by-pixel with each tap. Planned on making this website easy-to-use for mobile devices.

Functionalities offered:
1. Enter no. of Square per Side ->
Click on this to resize canvas pixelation. (Like changing resolution)

2. Hide Grid/ Show Grid ->
By default, you will be seeing grids on your canvas. This button can toggle this grid on and off.

3. Random Color Pen ->
Enable a pen to make each cell of random color as you draw strokes over them.

4. Pressure Pen ->
This pen is selected by default. Default color is black.
Although the name is pressure pen, it give an illusion that it work likes a pressure sensitive pen but in reality, it increases opacity as you make one stroke over another.

5. Eraser ->
Enable an eraser pen to eraser drawing on canvas.

6. Select Color ->
This functionality takes your input color and apply it on pressure pen. Default color is black.
